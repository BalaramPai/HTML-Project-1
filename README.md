# HTML-Project-1
First HTML Project (Based on student help).
This is my first HTML project where I have made a WebSite , based on helping students to acceess basic and necessary features for learning HTML, from addition of links to Github repositories, youtube tutorials,online coding platforms and much more. 
Further more it also includes a signup and login page with appropriate details to be entered ,coded with the right parameters. 
It includes a page with detailed description about, what the website provides as well.
Lastly it also includes a feedback page, which obtains a detailed feedback from the user.
Note:It has only been coded using HTML and no use of CSS or JAVASCRIPT has been used,BUT its is noteworthy that it is an interactive page (with as much options provided by HTML alone.)
